    "I'm totally agree with this statement. This is a problem which is always more frequent in the last time. This is for differents reasons: the first is that today the advertisements are much common then before. We can see and hear it everywhere, not only by the normal medium which the television or the radio.Looking a sport match, or simply taking a walk on a street we will notice that the numbes of advertisments is visible increased. And if there are always more pubblicity, the corporations who made the advertisements are in a strong competion with the others corporations who made the advertisement for a similar product. This Competition are the main reason who move a corporation to tells lies about his own product. In this way they wants to convince the acquirent to buy a product who should be positively different  by an other from a different corporation.The ones who could trying  to stop this process are the customers. In the last fifteen years several customers association are born to to contrast every form of unreal illegal advertisements.              \n",
